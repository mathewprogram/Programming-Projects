        <li><b>What is Charles Dawrin famous for?</b><ul>
        <li>Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection is the foundation upon which modern evolutionary theory is built. </li>
        <li>The theory was outlined in Darwin’s seminal work On the Origin of Species, published in 1859.</li>
        <li>Although Victorian England (and the rest of the world) was slow to embrace natural selection as the mechanism that drives evolution, the concept of evolution itself gained widespread traction by the end of Darwin’s life.</li></ul>
        <li><b>What were the social impacts of Charles Dawrin´s work?</b><ul>
        <li>Charles Darwin’s theories hugely impacted scientific thought. But his ideas also affected the realms of politics, economics, and literature. More insidious were the ways that Darwin’s ideas were used to support theories such as <a id="tribut-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-Darwinism" target="_blank" >social Darwinism</a> and <a id="tributlink" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/eugenics-genetics" target="_blank" >eugenics</a>, which used <a id="tribut-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/biological-determinism" target="_blank" >biological determinism</a> to advocate for the elimination of people deemed socially unfit.</li>
        <li>Although Darwin himself was an abolitionist, the social Darwinist ideas inspired by his work contributed to some of the most racist and classist social programs of the last 150 years.</li></ul>
        <li><b>What was Charles Darwin´s family life like?</b><ul>
        <li>Charles Darwin was born in England to a well-to-do family in 1809. His father was a doctor, and his mother—who died when he was only eight years old—was the daughter of a successful 18th-century industrialist. Darwin was not the first of his family to gravitate toward naturalism: his father’s father, Erasmus Darwin, was a physician, inventor, and poet who had developed his own theories on the evolution of species. Darwin later married his first cousin on his mother’s side, Emma Wedgwood. Together they had 10 children, 3 of whom died at a young age.</li></ul>
